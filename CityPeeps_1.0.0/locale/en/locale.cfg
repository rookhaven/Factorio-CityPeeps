k2cp-update-interval=Double value determining frequency of CityPeeps updates.  The default 1 updates entities once per Factorio day or every 7 minutes.  A value of 0.01 would be 100 times faster and 10 would be 10 days per update.  Among other things, updates cycle through city growth which affects generation of students and households.  So if you update more frequently, your consumption and growth will be that much faster.  For playtesting I use 0.01.  For performance, I wouldn't go below 0.05.
k2cp-max-districts=Example:  At an update interval of one, 210 districts would consume 30 of each crate per minute at 7 minutes per day.
